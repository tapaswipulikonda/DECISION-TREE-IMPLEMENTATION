# DECISION-TREE-IMPLEMENTATION

COMPANY : CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME : Pulikonda Tapaswi

INTERN ID : CT2MTDM339

DOMAIN : Machine Learning

DURATION : 8 WEEKS

MENTOR : NEELA SANTOSH

# DESCRIPTION
The objective of this project is to build, train, and visualize a Decision Tree classifier using the Scikit-learn library. This model aims to classify data based on provided features, demonstrating the interpretability and predictive power of decision tree algorithms in machine learning.

# Tools and Technologies:
Language: Python
IDE: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
Libraries:
pandas – data loading and manipulation
numpy – numerical operations
matplotlib – data visualization and tree plotting
sklearn – decision tree implementation, model training and evaluation

# Dataset Used:
We used the Heart Disease Dataset (sample/custom version) for classification. The target variable is target, where:
1 indicates the presence of heart disease
0 indicates absence of heart disease

Features include:

Age, Sex, Chest pain type, Resting blood pressure, Cholesterol, Fasting blood sugar, etc.
